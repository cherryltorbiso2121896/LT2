Ingredients  <br>

  500 mls of real ale<br>

  2 fat cloves of garlic<br>
  tbsp of plain flour<br>
</p>
<p>Method<br>
  Raw beef, roll it in the flour...fry 4N5 pieces at a time in a hot saucepan to 
  seal...put to one side when all done  cut the onions into quarters...fry in the same frying pan as the beef...to soak up 
  the juices...<br>
  Towards the end of frying the onion (they should be nicely brown round the 
  edges) throw in the smashed up cloves of garlic.<br>
  Transfer the beef, onions, garlic to a deep casserole dish. Stir in the remaining 
  flour<br>
  pour on the bottle of beer N really, it isn't going to be wasted!!!<br>
  Cover, and cook at 150 for about   and a half hours...will be gorgeous when it 
comes out, trust me...serve with mash</p>
